Exercise 1: Coding is Cool- 10 Marks
"""
"""
⁤We created 3 variables to store our data, our string.
⁤The string we use is called 'coding' and we store it in the variable called word1,
then 'is' and store it in the variable called word2 and finally 'cool' and\
store it in the variable called word3. 
"""

word1 = "coding"
word2 = "is"
word3 = "cool"

"""
This code makes an sentence by combining the  variable: word1, word2, and word3.
What that means is that f inside the string before the string it’s going to use f string,
f string is just a string with variables inside of it you can write it directly.
This is replaced by variables using {}.
"""
sentence = (f"{word1} {word2} {word3}")
print (sentence)

"""
using the print command, we can just print the variable sentence to see our result
